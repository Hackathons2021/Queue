# Queue App

An app that aids establishments in enforcing social distancing measures with a crowd management system. The app enables the shop to organize customers in a queue. The app notifies the user when it is his turn in the queue to approach the shop. The user can join a queue by a simple input of the shop's unique code.

We plan to expand it to include all establshments in a area.

# How it works

A firebase backend connects the two sides of the app - Customer and Business. Login has been made password-free with the support of SawoLabs.

# Instructions
Launch the App. Register yourself through sawolabs as a business or a customer. If you are a business you will be directed to your dashboard to start a session and accept the queue request and manage the queue. If you are a customer you will be asked to enter the restaurant code you wish to go to and will be displayed your current queue number on acceptance
