# About the App
The other day, a member of our team went to KMart to pick up a couple groceries and found themself in quite the predicament. They noticed KMart had three people dedicated just to managing this line, with two people at either door counting people. Meanwhile, everyone in line was getting anxious because it was unnerving to be in such close proximity to so many people (many not wearing masks) for such a long period of time, despite all social distancing precautions.

Since the COVID-19 crisis hit, many retail stores and grocery outlets have this same issue, and all of us are suffering waiting in lines. With more people leaving their homes and summer heat fast approaching, we’re positive that the pain experienced waiting in line will only get worse.

Queue is a simple line management solution built to solve the pain of long socially-distanced lines at retail shops, grocery stores...anywhere with a socially-distanced line, because of limiting the number of customers in a store.

An app that aids establishments in enforcing social distancing measures with a crowd management system. The app enables the shop to organize customers in a queue. The app notifies the user when it is his turn in the queue to approach the shop. The user can join a queue by a simple input of the shop's unique code.

# How it works for Customers
Customers enter the queue with a unique code of the store. Customers will be notified via text when they are “next in line” Customers will be notified via text when they are allowed to enter

# How it works for businesses:
The “line manager” tells customers to enter a code Line manager uses real time firebase database Upon changing order status of each “spot in line,” customers receive a text message to either begin heading over to the store entrance or that they are now allowed to enter the store

# Instructions
Launch the App. Register yourself through sawolabs as a business or a customer. If you are a business you will be directed to your dashboard to start a session and accept the queue request and manage the queue. If you are a customer you will be asked to enter the restaurant code you wish to go to and will be displayed your current queue number on acceptance
