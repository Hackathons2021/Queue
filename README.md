# Queue App

An app that aids establishments in enforcing social distancing measures with a crowd management system. The app enables the shop to organize customers in a queue. The app notifies the user when it is his turn in the queue to approach the shop. The user can join a queue by a simple input of the shop's unique code.

We plan to expand it to include all establshments in a area.

# How it works

A firebase backend connects the two sides of the app - Customer and Business. Login has been made password-free with the support of SawoLabs.
